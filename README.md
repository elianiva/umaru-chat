# Umaru Chat
Simple chat application built using React, Typescript and Firebase. Might be a bit buggy since this is my first time making something this big. This might looks like a small app but this is my biggest app yet. My first time using Typescript with React and Firebase so the code quality isn't top notch.

Took me about a month. To be fair, it shouldn't be that long if I'm not so busy with school stuff.
